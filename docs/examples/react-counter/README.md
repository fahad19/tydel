# React Counter Example

[React.js](https://facebook.github.com/react) example in a single HTML file, demonstrating a counter using a Model, and two buttons for incrementing and decrementing the value, and re-rendering by listening to changes.

Same as [basic counter](../counter/README.md) example, but done in React.
